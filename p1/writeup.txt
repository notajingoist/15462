Implemented Features:

Camera 
    Projection Transformations
        Used gluPerspective() with the given fovy, aspect ratio, near, and
        far. 
    
    Viewing Transformations
        Used gluLookAt() with the given camera position, target (direction +
        position), and camera up orientation. 

    Modeling Transformations
        Used glPushMatrix() and glPopMatrix() to isolate the modeling
        transformations for the pool mesh and the waves.

Meshes
    Pool
        Used the given Vector3 vertices and unpacked them into a sequence of
        x, y, z points to be rendered with vertex arrays. Used glDrawElement()
        with the given triangle indices to render the points as triangles.
    Waves (Heightmap)
        Used a grid of 128 x 128 x-z points to compute each point's y value.
        Stored these x, y, z values as Vector3 objects in a 2d array instance
        variable that would get updated upon each update call. Unpacked these
        into a sequence of x, y, z points to be rendered with vertex arrays.
        This sequence was based on determining which triangles to draw for
        each point in the grid (2 triangles per point).  

Normals
    Loop through all vertices in the mesh (no duplicates) and then loop
    through all the triangles. For each triangle such that the vertex was in
    that triangle, compute the normal for that triangle and add it to the
    average running sum of normals for that vertex. Normalize after all
    triangles have been checked. Use vertex arrays for rendering.


Lighting & Materials
    Used one light source with ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting
    effects. Specified different material characteristics for the pool and
    waves within their respective push/pop matrices.

Colors
    No creativity. Just used red and blue.
